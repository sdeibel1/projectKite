# Project Kite

https://github.com/sdeibel1/projectKite

Use PhoneGap to play Project Kite on mobile (Project Kite should be played on mobile, not desktop)
If you're on school/public WiFi, set up a hot spot from your phone to run it off of. If you have a Mac, you can 
instead create a local network and connect your phone to that instead.
